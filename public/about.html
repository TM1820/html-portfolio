<br>
<p>Hello, visitors. I come from Delhi, which is in India; been living in the beautiful state of Indore in central India since the start of 2022. I have recently graduated with a M.Sc. degree in Biotechnology from Indian Institute of Technology, Indore. 
  I do not come from a development background, but I have decided to equip myself with programming skills. 
  The simple reason is that I want to be able to create something meaningful, and I think coding skills will sure help me in doing so. 
  The language of my choice is Python, due to it having wide applications, from web development to machine learning and data science. 
  A lot of computational biology also requires programming skills and here Python will help me in future career-directions toward biological data science.

  In my leisure time, I really enjoy listening to music. 
  I also watch a lot of stories, in the form of anime as well as books. 
  Other times, I like to play sports with friends.

Cheers,<br>
